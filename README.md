# Decentralized Multi-AMR Warehouse Coordination

### SIH 2026 — Problem Statement 26123

An edge-oriented simulation and coordination framework for multiple
Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operating in a shared warehouse environment.

The system focuses on three core challenges:

- Decentralized inter-robot coordination
- Conflict resolution and collision avoidance
- Dynamic task allocation and recovery

The project is designed around local robot decision-making, while the
dashboard is used for monitoring and visualization.

## Problem

In a smart warehouse, multiple AMRs may need to use the same aisles,
intersections, and choke points at the same time.

A centralized stop-and-wait approach can cause:

- unnecessary waiting
- congestion at narrow intersections
- deadlocks
- poor task throughput
- difficulty recovering when an aisle or robot becomes unavailable

This project explores a decentralized approach in which each robot maintains
its own state, plans its movement, communicates intent with peers, and adapts
when the environment changes.

---

## Proposed Approach

The system follows the pipeline:

**Task → Assignment → Path Planning → Reservation → Coordination → Execution → Replanning**

Each robot maintains local information such as:

- current position and velocity
- assigned task
- planned path
- reservations
- peer intent
- communication quality
- battery/state information

When a conflict or failure is detected, the robot can wait, yield, reroute,
or enter a degraded operating mode depending on the situation.

## Key Components

### 1. Path Planning

The simulator uses grid-based path planning with A* and a space-time
representation for considering reservations and movement over time.

### 2. Multi-Robot Coordination

Robots exchange intent/state information and use reservations to reduce
conflicts at shared cells and intersections.

The coordination layer includes:

- vertex conflict detection
- edge-swap conflict detection
- intersection checks
- priority handling
- deadlock detection
- replanning

### 3. Dynamic Task Allocation

Tasks are assigned to available robots using a Hungarian-algorithm-based
allocator.

The system also supports task recovery when a robot becomes unavailable.

### 4. Failure Handling

The simulator includes scenarios for:

- blocked aisles
- robot failure
- communication degradation/loss
- task reassignment
- replanning

### 5. Edge Decision Layer

A local policy layer is provided for robot-side decisions such as:

- `CONTINUE`
- `YIELD`
- `WAIT`
- `REROUTE`
- `DEGRADED_MODE`

A deterministic safety policy acts as the fallback/guard layer, while an
ONNX-based policy can be evaluated locally.

### 6. Communication & Security

The communication layer provides a pluggable message-channel abstraction
for peer coordination.

The security layer includes validation concepts such as:

- robot authentication
- message integrity
- sequence checking
- freshness checking
- physical plausibility checks

### 7. Dashboard

A web dashboard provides visualization and monitoring of the simulation
and experiment results.
